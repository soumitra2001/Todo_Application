## Required Dependencies

To run this project, you will need to add the following dependencies to your pom.xml file

`Spring Web`, `Spring Boot Dev Tool`, `Lombok`, `Validation`

## Entity
The main entity in this application is the `Todo` object, which represents a single `todo` item. Each Todo object has the following properties:

`id`: The unique identifier of the todo item.

`title`: The title or description of the todo item.

`status`: The status of the todo item (e.g., completed, pending, in progress).


## Controller
The `TodoController` class, located in the controller package, provides various methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the todo list.

### Methods
`getAllTodos`: This method retrieves all the todos in the list.

`getTodosByStatus`: This method retrieves todos based on their status.

`getTodoById`: This method retrieves a todo item by its unique identifier.

`addTodo`: This method adds a new todo item to the list.

`deleteTodoById`: This method deletes a todo item from the list based on its identifier.

`updateTodoStatusById`: This method updates the status of a todo item based on its identifier.


Please note that the application assumes the usage of appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, DELETE, PUT/PATCH) to interact with the RESTful endpoints provided by the TodoController.
